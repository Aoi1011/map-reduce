# Asynchronous

### ABI (application binary interface)
Specifies a set of rules that programmer has to adhere to for their programs to work correctly on that platform.
A very important part of the ABI that operating systems must specify is its **calling convention**.

CPU architecture

### ISA (instruction set architecture)
Describes an abstract model of a CPU that defines how the CPU is constrolled by the software it runs.
It defines what instructions the CPU can execute, what registers programmers can use, how the hardware manages memory...
Ex: X86-64k x86, ARM ISA

CPUs implement and instruction set. 

## Map Reduce

### Abstract
- for processing and generating large data sets
- parallelized and executed on a large cluster of commodity machines

### Programming model
2 main functions

1. Map
	written by the user, takes an input pair and produces a set of intermediate key/value pairs

2. Reduce
	also written by the user, accepts an intermediate key I and a set of values for that key. It merges togetherthese values to form a possibly smaller set of values. 

```
map(String key, String value): 
 // key: document name
 // value: document contents
 for each word w in value:
  EmitIntermediate(w, "1");

reduce(String key, Iterator values):
 // key: a word
 // values: a list of counts
 int result = 0;
 for each v in values:
  result += ParseInt(v);
 Emit(AsString(result));
```
